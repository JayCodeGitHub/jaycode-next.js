      I like to create things that live on the internet. 
      For several years I have been developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
      I will be a good member of the team because I learn quickly and work well in a team.

      During my education I had the opportunity to create simple websites and large Full Stack applications. 
      I also had the opportunity to work on commercial projects, where I learned how to work with clients and select technologies for specific requirements. 
      I can create applications based on frameworks such as React and NEXT.JS. I have experience working with Git and GitHub.`,
